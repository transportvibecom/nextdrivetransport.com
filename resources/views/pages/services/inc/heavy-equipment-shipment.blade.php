Motorized vehicles like cars and tractors drive onto the trailer on their own wheels, while equipment not self-propelled is placed on handling equipment with wheels and rolled on and off the vessel.</div>

                                            one of the most cost effective factor is size of the shipping equipment. Flatbed hauls are the most used transport and will be efficient for most heavy large items. Rarely case that you require more than a flatbed.
