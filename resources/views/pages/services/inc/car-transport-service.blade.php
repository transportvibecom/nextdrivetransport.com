                                            An open-trailer car shipping is exactly how it sounds. Open-trailer means that the trailer does not have external coverage to shield your vehicle. Most open-trailers are long, two-tier trailers that are fit for all car types. This form of carrier is the best choice for any used vehicles or standard vehicle models to ship cheaper and faster.

                                            Enclosed auto transportation involves transporting vehicles in enclosed trailers, providing protection from external elements such as weather, debris, and potential road hazards. This method is preferred for transporting high-value, classic, luxury, or exotic cars, as it offers added security and ensures pristine condition upon arrival.
